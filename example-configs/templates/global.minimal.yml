## This is the global config, which is prepopulated with some keybinds. The commented lines below can help you see how to configure it.
#
# ⚠️  "Alt-" shortcuts are case-sensitive! "Alt-b" and "Alt-B" are different, i.e. 'Alt-B' is actually 'Shift+Alt+b'.

global:
  # Keybinds are not behind a leader key.
  keybinds: []  # WARNING: Remove the '[]' here to add keybinds below.
    # - key: "Alt-p"
    #   zle: push-line # To bind to a Zsh builtin, use the `zle` key.
    # - key: "Ctrl-G"
    #   command: "!!^M"  # You can add '^M' to simulate an Enter/Return press. 
    # - key: "Alt-g" # Caution: the letter in 'Alt' combos is case sensitive, so it determines whether Shift is required.
    #   command: "!-2^M"
    # - key: "F1"  # Function keys may not work, depending on platform/terminal.
    #   command: "git status"

  ## You can have any number of leader keys. Each one has a tree of combos beneath it.
  leader_keys:
    # The main leader key collection with commands. You might want to add another, to deconflict
    # or to have a set of postfix aliases etc.

        -- -- Lines in this section are commented out with two leading dashes ('--').

        -- -- You can have nested modifier combos. This means that pressing Ctrl-S twice
        -- -- (once to trigger blz and once to trigger the shortcut below) will run 'fg'.

# # Profiles define a set of keybindings specific to a type of project.
# # They can activate automatically in directories which contain a glob
# # pattern, or directories within a defined parent. Alternatively, a local
# # .blz.yml file can inherit the profile to bring in its keybindings.

#       # Only activate in any directory underneath "~/projects/cpp/", or if a makefile is present.
