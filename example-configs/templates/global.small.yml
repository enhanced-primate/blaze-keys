## This is the global config, which is prepopulated with some keybinds. The commented lines below can help you see how to configure it.
#
# ⚠️  "Alt-" shortcuts are case-sensitive! "Alt-b" and "Alt-B" are different, i.e. 'Alt-B' is actually 'Shift+Alt+b'.

global:
  # Keybinds are not behind a leader key.
  keybinds:
    - key: "Alt-p"
      zle: push-line # To bind to a Zsh builtin, use the `zle` key.
    - key: "Ctrl-G"
      command: "!!^M"  # You can add '^M' to simulate an Enter/Return press. 
    - key: "Alt-g" # Caution: the letter in 'Alt' combos is case sensitive, so it determines whether Shift is required.
      command: "!-2^M"
    - key: "F1"  # Function keys may not work, depending on platform/terminal.
      command: "git status"

  ## You can have any number of leader keys. Each one has a tree of combos beneath it.

    # The main leader key collection with commands. You might want to add another, to deconflict
    # or to have a set of postfix aliases etc.
